!! MY MAIN IS MILESTONE6 !!



I didnt figure out how to do the Milestone7 due the short time we had ( we had 2 weeks at all but the first week[sukot] was told in the beggin of the course 
that we have a "rest-week" so I planned to travel with friends) and also my extremely difficult to work with javascript modules ( import/export ) no matter what I
tried and searched its just doesnâ€™t worked ,so I was limited to acess variables when working on different classes , in different j.s files.
I know there I didnt write some parts of my code in the "best way" and miss some details but I did my best for the time I had.
